# Battleship-game
The battleship game or naval battle game consists of sinking all the opponent's ships. This is both a game of reflection and a gamble. A user may play against the computer or, two users may play against each other. All the players have an equal number of ships. At the beginning of the game, they are given the possibility to position their boats as they wish.

There are 4 types of boats:
1) Speedboats (which are one-box-long);
2) Torpedo boats (which are 2-box-long);
3) Submarines (which are 3-box-long);
4) Aircraft carriers (which are 4-box-long).
The longer a ship is, the more difficult it is to sink it. To make a boat sink, all its boxes (parts) must be attacked!

FAQ:


1) How is an attack performed?
Ans: To attack, you simply need to enter the coordinates of the position you want to bombard. It's important to note that the game has been built in 2-dimensions: consequently, the coordinates of an attack is of the form (x,y).

2) How do we win?
Ans: To win, you just need to sink all your opponent's boats.
NB: It's a one after another game! that's is, the two players can't attack simultaneously!

3)In which language is the game designed?
Ans: In C

4)Are there different levels?
Ans: Yes! There are 3 levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Expert. These levels differ in the size of the sea, and not the number of boats used! that is, in the level expert, the sea is largest, thereby making it more diffifcult to sink a boat.

5) How are the boats differentiated in the sea?
Ans: Apart from the fact that the boats are of different length, there is another way of distinguishing them: A Speedboat is represented by 'V', Torpedo boat is represented by 'T', a submarine boat is represented by 'S', and an aircraft carrier is represented by 'P'.

6) How do I know that an attack was successful?
Ans: If you touched your target, the message "touched" will appear; if you didn't, then the message "In water" will appear. If you touched your target and made it sink then the message "sunk" will appear.
